Our vision is to be a church that is doing what God calls the church to do. We did not want to be unique in our vision, and that is why you will see our vision is a combination of the greatest commandment (to love the Lord with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind), the second greatest commandment (to love your neighbor as yourself), and the great commission (to make disciples of all nations). We want each of our members to know, embrace, and embody this vision.
