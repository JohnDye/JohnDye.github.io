<p>This Sunday Chris Gaynor will be joining us from the Summit Church in Raleigh, NC. Chris is the pastor of Worship and Prayer and has served there since 1986. I had the privilege of getting to know Chris during my time at Summit, and when I heard he and his family were coming to Atlanta I told him he had to come visit us! I have been deeply encouraged by Chris’s teaching. He has a love for God and people, and an honesty about life that makes him easy to understand and relate with. I m excited to have Chris come to Bridgeway primarily for those reasons, but I am also looking forward to him coming because he was a part the replanting process at Summit Church. He was on staff during a time of pruning and then helped the church restructure and take off. I have asked him to preach God’s word and share some of his own story with us. I think it will be an encouraging time for everyone as we replant Bridgeway. I hope you can be there!
