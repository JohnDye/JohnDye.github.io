<p>This past Sunday Bridgeway Church donated 25 Mother’s Day Baskets to <a href="https://www.friendsofbeacon.com/" target="_blank">Beacon of Hope Crisis Pregnancy Center in John’s Creek</a>. We wanted to bless people in our community that might be having a tough time. Below is a thank you note from their communications coordinator. Please read it and be encouraged. We also wanted to give a big thank you to Daylee Tapia who helped connect Bridgeway to Beacon of Hope and organized getting all the goodies to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thank you again so much for the adorable mother’s day baskets! We were all commenting on the perfect timing of the gift as the ladies had not been able to shop in our boutique for a couple weeks due to the remodeling. It was such a blessing to be able to honor them for mother’s day and they were given the bags later the same day. All the women in our Bridge program were classified as planning to abort or vulnerable to an abortion decision and had to overcome obstacles to choose life. Thank you for helping us celebrate these brave moms! I’ve sent a thank you note to your congregation and written a little shout out to them on our facebook page. Have a great weekend with your precious family!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Below is a picture of Daylee delivering the baskets with her son Sebastian, the baskets that were given, and also some information on the <a href="https://www.friendsofbeacon.com/" target="_blank">pregnancy center</a>. Let’s continue to lift up in prayer the moms and the ministry of <a href="https://www.friendsofbeacon.com/" target="_blank">Beacon of Hope</a>.</p>
