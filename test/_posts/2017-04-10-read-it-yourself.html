excerpt: I wanted to post some passages in the Bible that give the account of the crucifixion and explain why it matters. I hope you will pick a couple passages to read for yourself and take a few minutes to read them and reflect on why it is such an important event.

<p>Multitudes of people around the world will go to church this Sunday to celebrate Easter. Many of those will go knowing little about the event they are celebrating. I did this for years, going to church but not understanding what happened and why it mattered. It wasn't until reading the Bible for myself that I began to understand the events and their significance. Since there are probably many like me, instead of writing about Easter, I wanted to post some passages in the Bible that give the account of the crucifixion and explain why it matters. I hope you will pick a couple passages to read for yourself and take a few minutes to read them and reflect on why it is such an important event.

<h4>The Arrest and Crucifixion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Matt 26:36-27:66 </li>
<li>Luke 22:39-23:56 </li>
<li>John 18:1-19:42</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Resurrection of Jesus</h4>
<ul><li>Matt 28:1-19  </li>
<li>John 20:1:30 </li>
<li>Luke 24:1-50</li>
</ul>

<h4>Why it Matters</h4>
<ul><li><strong>Romans 8:1-18.</strong> v11 "If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you." </li>
<li><strong>Isaiah 52:13-53:12.</strong> 53:4 "Surely he has born our griefs and carried our sorrows... he was pierced for our transgressions... crushed for our iniquities... the punishment that brought us peace was upon him..." </li>
<li><strong>1 Peter 2:22-25.</strong> He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. 23 When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. 24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. 25 For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</li>
</ul>
