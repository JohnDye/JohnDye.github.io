<p>On Sunday July 2 we will have guest preacher Dustin Willis with us at Bridgeway. Dustin is the executive director of marketing and events at the North American Mission Board. He has authored several books including:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Mission-Joining-Everyday-God/dp/0802412211" target="_blank"><em>Life on Mission</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Community-Joining-Together-Display/dp/0802413323" target="_blank"><em>Life on Community</em></a></li>
</ul>

<p>We hope that Dustinâ€™s wisdom and passion for advancing the gospel by living life on life with other people will help Bridgeway better reach the community. Dustin also lives in Alpharetta with his wife, Renie, and their two kids, Jack and Piper.</p>

<p>I am praying this Sunday plays an important part in Bridgeway redefining itself to better reach our neighbors. If you are not able to attend this Sunday please take time to listen to the sermon online.</p>
