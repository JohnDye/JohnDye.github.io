<p>We are excited to announce that Kyle Rowe will be joining the Bridgeway staff as our new worship leader! This has been a key position to fill, and over the last couple months we had the privilege of interacting with a number of very talented and capable people, and we think Kyle will be a great fit for us. As the elders looked into who to hire, we hoped to get someone musically gifted and a heart to lead others through music into worshipping God. Kyle demonstrated both of these and also an eagerness to jump into the community of Bridgeway church. We think his gifting and experience will help us to move forward in significant ways, and we are looking forward to him joining the team on March 12. Here is a little info about him.
</p>

<p>Kyle was born in Tacoma, Washington. He moved to Dahlonega, Georgia at the age of 14 and has lived in Georgia ever since. He came to faith in Christ at the age of 16 at a local church in his hometown. It was there he became a part of the student worship band. In 2015 Kyle took part of a leadership development program called the Protégé Program at Stonecreek Church in Alpharetta, Georgia. This program trained and equipped him to lead worship teams as well as lead in front of the congregation.
Kyle is also a student at the University of North Georgia working on his Bachelor’s degree in Film and Media.
