<p>Summer vacation is over. Kids are back in school. And it is a great time to come to Bridgeway Church! Sunday, August 20, 2017, we start the first week of a new series on the book of 1 Timothy. In this book a young man named Timothy is charged with being faithful to his calling and resisting opposition. We hope that by studying the book we too will see God’s calling, push aside hindrances, and experience a recharging for what God has for us. <strong>Join us Sundays at 9:30am!</strong></p>
<p>Whether it is your first time to Bridgeway or first time in a long time we would love to have you! If you are new to the faith or mature in your faith, we hope you experience a warm reception, an engaging message, and a genuine community to connect with. If you have questions email us <a href="mailto:hello@bridgeway.net">hello@bridgeway.net</a></p>
<p>Don’t get run down in life... come get charged! </p>
