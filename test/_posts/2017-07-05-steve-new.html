<p>This Sunday, July 23rd Steve New and his family will be back at Bridgeway for a visit. Steve served at Bridgeway for 3 years as the Family Life Pastor before moving to Thailand in 2014 as a missionary. It was during a seminary mission trip to Thailand that Steve felt God calling him and his family to sell everything and move there to minister. Bridgeway continues to hold the News Family very dear to them and wants to learn from them and encourage them.</p>
<p>Steve will be preaching in the main service and during our second our class will be sharing more about the work that they have been doing to reach the lost. We hope it will be an encouraging time for Bridgeway Church and also for the News. You can be praying for them as they enjoy a break from the field.</p>
<p>Hope you will join us this Sunday at 9:30am!</p>
