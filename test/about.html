        <div class="description">
            <p>Bridgeway Church was started in 1985 by two seminary students who were exploring the need for a church in the growing suburbs of Alpharetta. A small group of twenty people started meeting and a church was planted. The church began growing, hired a lead pastor, and over the next couple decades purchased land, built buildings, and started Bridgeway Christian Academy.</p>
            <p>After many great years, Bridgeway went through a series of challenges and a season of decline. In the fall of 2015 the church began a process of reevaluation, and the elders felt a deep change would best position the church to reach the local community in the future. The decision was made to replant the church with a fresh vision and approach, and a new lead pastor was called in November 2016.</p>
            <p>The church is in process of strategizing and dreaming a new dream for its purpose in the community and what God can do through it. With new leadership and fresh vision, it is a great time to visit the church. (We are a smaller congregation but full of faith that great things can and are happening.) We have had our bumps in the road but believe God is replanting us for the future. We know many others have had bumps in the road and may need some replanting in their own faith. If you find yourself in that place please know we would love to have you.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">Our vision is to be a church that is doing what God calls the church to do. We did not want to be unique in our vision, and that is why you will see our vision is a combination of the greatest commandment (to love the Lord with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind), the second greatest commandment (to love your neighbor as yourself), and the great commission (to make disciples of all nations). We want each of our members to know, embrace, and embody this vision.</p>
            <p class="text-center">Worshipping God. Loving others. <br>
            Influencing the world... one person at a time.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">Our mission gets at how we want to go about our vision and explains some of the distinctives you will find at Bridgeway:</p>
            <p class="text-justify">We want to be a family oriented church that is passionately worshipping God (Deut 6:5, Matt 22:37), personally connected to others (Acts 2:42, Eph 2:11-22), firmly rooted in the Word (Eph 4:11-16, Luke 6:47-49), deeply involved in the local community (Jer 29, 1 Pet 4:9-10), graciously sharing the faith (John 13:35, Titus 2:9-10), and equipping each member to make a difference in the lives of others. (Eph 4:11-16).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Our Core Values further help you know what is important at Bridgeway and gives you a sense of who we are.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><strong>Gospel</strong>: The gospel is the goodnews that God is redeeming the world through Jesus Christ. This good news permeates and motivates everything we do, from Sunday preaching to Monday work, Bible studies to soccer games, church services to community events. Christ is the center and focus of all we do. (1 Cor 15:1-4, 2 Cor 5:14)</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><strong>Worship</strong>: we want every member passionately celebrating and honoring Christ in all that they do, think, and say. Every day is a day to celebrate his work. Every place is a place of worship. (Deut 6:5, Matt 22:37, John 4:23-24)</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><strong>Community</strong>: God draws us into relationship with him and that leads to relationships with other believers. Genuine personal relationships are the seedbed of genuine Christian service and mission. (Acts 2:42, Eph 2:22, Eph 4)</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><strong>Mission</strong>: The good news can’t be contained. We want to proclaim it to others in word and deed, by both the church corporately (church planting, evangelists, corporate meetings, support of domestic and foreign missions) and as individual members (in families, offices, and neighborhoods). (Matt 28:18)</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><strong>Unity</strong>: Racial, economic, and ethnic barriers are great, but the gospel is greater. Christ makes it possible for people of different backgrounds come together as brothers and sisters. Bridgeway is a diverse group of people with varied giftings, backgrounds, and callings that are casting aside those differences and in order to unite together in the common goal of worshipping God and advancing his kingdom. (1 Cor 12:12-27, Eph 2:14)</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><strong>Neighbors</strong>: God has placed us in the lives of people living in this north Georgia cross section of cities and counties. We want to be good neighbors and seek to know, bless, and influence those around us. We want to intentionally remember and help the hurting, struggling, and forgotten in the area. We believe affecting the world begins with first helping those next door. (Jer 29:4-7, 1 Tim 5:8, Matt 22:39).</p>
