        <div class="description">
            <p>Financial giving at Bridgeway Church can generally be divided into two categories: tithes and offerings (Deut 12:11, Mal 3:8). The Bible teaches us that we worship the Lord with our tithe, which is ten percent of our income contributed to the church on a regular basis. 

            <p>When we feel called to give over and above our tithe, we do so as an offering. The ministry of Bridgeway Church is funded by God's provision through the tithes and offerings of faithful members and attendees. At Bridgeway Church, we honor God's provision by exercising wise and faithful stewardship, ethical business practices, and full accountability so that the financial integrity of Bridgeway Church remains beyond reproach.</p>

            <p>There are numerous safe and secure ways to give at Bridgeway Church. Each method allows for God's work to be completed as you demonstrate your faith and give a portion of your blessings to others. </p>

            <p><strong>The first way is “Cash”</strong>. On Sunday take advantage of an envelope provided to secure your donation and to provide your name to update your giving record for tax purposes. All loose cash is given to the General Fund.</p>

            <p><strong>The second way is by “Check”</strong>. This method provides you with a record of your gift and provides the Church with the necessary information to update your giving record and to properly designate your donation.</p>

            <p><strong>The third way is by “Bill Pay” through your bank</strong>. As we move more towards internet banking, this method provides a safe and secure means to give your donation. Under this method your bank mails a “Check” to the church. This provides you with the ability to establish your giving on a recurring basis without having to remember to bring your checkbook to Church. It is safe and secure and provides you with the ability to designate your donation and to provide you with a record of your donation.</p>

            <p><strong>The fourth way is to use “Online Giving”</strong>. Online giving is a safe, secure and convenient way to support the ministries of Bridgeway Church. This secure system enables you to support the church by making a one-time contribution or establishing a recurring contribution. With online giving you have the option of using a credit card or giving directly from your checking account (Called an ACH transaction) The steps are simple.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Ask the church office to sign you up with a logon id and password.</li>
            <li>Create an online account using the information provided by the church office.</li>
            <li>Log on and provide contact and bank, credit union or credit card information.(Depends on your payment method - credit card or bank account)</li>
            <li>Indicate the amount, frequency (one-time or recurring) and designation for your gift from the drop down menu. </li>
            <li>Change your password to one you prefer.</li>
            <li>Write down your id and password and then logoff</li>
            </ol>


            <h3>Think Wisely about Using Credit Cards</h3>

            <p>While we allow the use of credit cards for tithes and offerings, we still strongly encourage the use of checks or electronic funds transfer rather than credit cards for two primary reasons:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Although many pay off their credit cards each month, many also do not. We do not want to encourage someone to go into debt (Prov 22:26) and also pay interest on gifts given to the church. We offer the opportunity to donate by credit card as a convenience for those individuals who have requested this type of transaction and who understand and manage their finances with no financial issues.</li>
                <li>With checks or electronic transfer, your entire gift goes to the church. When using a credit card, as much as 3% of your gift can go to the credit card company, although our system does allow the donor an option to pay the fees instead of the church.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>About Our Giving Platform</h3>
