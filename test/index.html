                        The amazing sense of family at Bridgeway Church has kept Sunday mornings exciting. It’s great to hear from our three young children about what they learned and see the crafts they make in their classes. My wife and I found the culture to be infectious service to God, each other and to the community - it isn’t a perfect church, of course there are always opportunities to improve. I think that’s part of what drew us in here; We are thrilled to be a part of what God is doing and to be a part of a growing solution to the needs of each other and His church.
