                We are so excited and grateful that you are considering coming to Bridgeway. We look forward to seeing you! If you have questions please <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link contact.html %}">contact us.</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                We are a church that loves God and people, and we believe you will experience this when you visit. The teaching and worship will be focused on the Bible and Christ’s work. If you want to “jump in with both feet” or check things out “from a distance” we are glad to have you and meet you where you are.
            </p>

            <p>
                Service starts at 9:30am and concludes about 10:45am. After the main service, there is a time to enjoy coffee and snacks and connect with others. At 11:00am various classes begin and you are warmly invited to participate. The lead pastor typically hosts an informal discussion on the sermon after the service, which is ideal for guests or those exploring the faith.
            </p>

                Since many people wonder, dress ranges between informal and business casual. We care more about who you are than what you wear so just come as you are.
            </p>

            <p>
                We also want you to know that in our Children’s ministry all volunteers are screened with background checks, we have a secure check in/out process, and if anything arises we will contact you.

            <p>Bridgeway Next Generation exists to build lasting relationships with your children and students and partner with you in helping them experience and follow after Jesus Christ. We divide Bridgeway Next Generation into age groups to help each child experience Jesus on their level. During worship service, we serve children from 6 months to 4 years old in a safe and secure environment. After worship service, during Connection Point, we have gatherings for children from 6 months to 12th grade, divided appropriately, to help each child or student grow in their relationship with Christ and in their relationships with one another.
