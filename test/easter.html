            <p>Easter changed the world forever. On Easter Jesus ushered in a new era of life after death, and showed life’s greatest enemy was defeated. He showed there is more to life than death and a greater hope for living than the world could offer.</p>

            <p>This Easter, Sunday April 16, 2017, at 9:30 AM, we invite you to join us as we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. We will sing songs, read the biblical account of the resurrection, and see how the resurrection makes a difference every day of the year.</p>
